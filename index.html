          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>As you navigate through the multiple charts available we can observe some intersting facts between<br> 
            <strong>lack of healtcare, smokers and obesity</strong> versus <strong>poverty rate, median age and median household income</strong>:
          </p>
          <p id="first"><strong>Let's first compare the poverty rate :</strong><br>
            We observe a ligth positive correlation between the poverty rate and the lack a healthcare. This means 
            the more a region is poor the bigger the lack of healthcare.<br>
            The observation is the same between the smokers and the poverty rate. This correlation seems a bit stronger than
            the correlation between poverty and healthcare. The more smokers in a region, the higher the rate of poverty.<br>
            We observe the same trend between obesity and poverty rate. The higher the poverty rate the higher the obesity rate.
            This is the strongest positive correlation observed for the poverty rate.
          </p>
          <p id="first"><strong>Let's now compare the median age :</strong><br> 
            We observe a small negative correlation between the median age and the lack of healthcare. This means that the younger,
            the less someone subscribes to a healthcare.<br>
            The correlation is less visible between the median age and the percent smokers in a region. A small positive correlation<br>
            The median age doesn't explain either the obesity rate.</p>

          <p id="first"><strong>Let's finally compare the household income :</strong><br>
            We observe a small negative correlation between the median income and the lack of healthcare. This means that the less income,
            the less someone subscribes to a healthcare.<br>
            The negative correlation is much more visible between the median income and the percent smokers in a region.The less people earn, 
            the more they smoke<br>
            We observe the same trend between the obesity and the income, the obesity rate is higher where the median income is lower</p>
